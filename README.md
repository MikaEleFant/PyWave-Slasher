# PyWave-Slasher

A 2D action scroller game created with the Pygame library. Heavily referencing Coder's Legacy's tutorial online for now, I intend to create a unique game by putting my own twist on the mechanics and enemies of this game.

Work In Progress.

The tutorial is found here: *[Coder's Legacy's Pygame RPG Tutorial](https://coderslegacy.com/python/pygame-rpg-game-tutorial/)*

## Current Task(s)

- Create enemy class
- Generate stages
- Generate enemies
- Implement damage
- Implement player health
