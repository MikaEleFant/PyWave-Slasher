# PyWave-Slasher

A 2D action scroller game created with the Pygame library. Heavily referencing Coder's Legacy's tutorial online, it offers a unique twist on action games by forcing players to only use magic as well as to choose between a wide range of spells for learning.

Work In Progress.

The tutorial is found here: *[Coder's Legacy's Pygame RPG Tutorial](https://coderslegacy.com/python/pygame-rpg-game-tutorial/)*
