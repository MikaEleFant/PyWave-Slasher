# PyWave-Slasher

This is my challenge at learning a Python library called Pygame. I am first following a tutorial found online on Pygame, after which I made my<br>
own modifications to transform this project into my own unique game. 

The tutorial is found here: *[Coder's Legacy's Pygame RPG Tutorial](https://coderslegacy.com/python/pygame-rpg-game-tutorial/)*

## Current Task(s)

## Next Task(s)
